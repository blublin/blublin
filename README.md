## From Audio Engineer to Software Engineer
![AudioEngineer](/imgs/audioEngineering.jpg)

Life has a way of changing paths. Sometimes it's expected, sometimes it's a wonderfully journey full of surprises!

After spending 4 years teaching and doing audio engineering, I realized that this just wasn't for me. I've spent time searching for what feels right to me.
What I realized is that I just love being in front of a keyboard: creating, problem-solving, testing, struggling, reviewing, and otherwise testing my limits as what I'm able to do! I absolutely love to learn and find myself being able to do a little more than I could the day before.
